# Character dossier

Give a reader or collector a sourced profile they can use: who the character is, which issues matter, and where to start reading.

The VerseDB MCP is Pro-only, every tool including search. If a call returns an auth/subscription error (`pro_required` / HTTP 402), tell the user it needs Pro and stop.

## Resolve the character

`search-tool` (`type: character`) first. Common names collide across publishers and legacies (think of all the Robins, or the various Captain Marvels). When several strong matches come back, show them with publisher/universe and let the user pick. Then `get-tool` (`type: character`) for the core record.

## Build the dossier

Gather each piece from its own source:

- **First appearance & key issues:** surface the debut and other significant books, labeled with their significance via `get-key-issue-reasons-tool` (1st appearance, origin, death, first cover, and so on).
- **Affiliations:** teams they belong to (`search-tool` (`type: team`) / `get-tool` (`type: team`)) and the universe they live in (`get-tool` (`type: universe`)).
- **Defining stories:** the story arcs and events they anchor (`search-tool` (`type: story_arc`), `search-tool` (`type: event`), `get-tool` (`type: event`)).
- **Notable runs:** the series where they're central (`search-tool` (`type: series`)), plus the creators most associated with them.

## Present it

Structure it so it scans:
1. **Who:** one paragraph on publisher, universe, alter ego, and debut year.
2. **Key issues:** bulleted, each with its significance and issue id, ordered by importance (1st appearance first). Flag which are expensive, cross-referencing `get-market-prices-tool` only if the user cares about value.
3. **Affiliations:** teams and universe.
4. **Defining stories:** arcs and events, in suggested reading order.
5. **Where to start:** one series plus issue, or a collected edition. Hand off to the `reading-order` skill for anything complex.

End by offering to save the key issues as a want-list, add them to the user's collection, or build a reading list.
